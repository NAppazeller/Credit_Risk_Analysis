# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview: 

Fast Lending, a lending services company, has asked for assistance accessing credit risk. The project will include building and evaluating six machine learning models to predict credit risk. The models will also be evaluated for performance and ability to predict data. The guiding objective is to expedite the loan approval process and deliver clients with low default rates.

## Results: 

Accuracy score: validating a model's performance
Precision (predictive value:  measure of the likelihood.
Recall: assess a model's performance with sensitivity or determine the accuracy of the precision
F1 score (harmonic mean) can be characterized as a single summary statistic of precision and sensitivity

* Oversampling

Balanced accuracy for the overampling method was 62.8%. High and low risk precision was

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
